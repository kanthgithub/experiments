# Code examples for my blog posts
Now and then I work with interesting technologies at my day job or dig deeper into something promising at night. Occasionally I learn things that I both find useful and do not see written about much. Usually it's related to OLAP, data storage, and query engines.

For historical reasons I stick to a pretty lame project naming convention though it makes clear what technology it's mostly about. If any of them attracts your attention you'd really need to start from my blog posts at http://ndolgov.blogspot.com . There I tend to indulge myself in vintage UML diagrams (shout-out to my all-time favorite https://www.websequencediagrams.com) but usually strive to be terse.
